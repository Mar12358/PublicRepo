# Algorithms and coding challenges: intro

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to actively check assumptions when bringing up a problem.
- Practice pseudocoding coding challenges.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions that are necessary to complete a specific task. Algorithms are present in our daily life, although we do not always think of them as algorithms. Imagine a cooking recipe — it is a set of instructions, right? So a recipe is basically an algorithm for creating a specific food.

In computing, an algorithm is the list of instructions and rules that a computer needs to do to complete a task. An algorithm is a way to tell a computer what to do and you as a programmer will be using them every day.

### Why is it important?

As a programmer, you need to be able to translate real-world problems into a set of instructions that a computer can use to solve those problems. In other words, you need to translate real-world problems into algorithms.

Learning about already known algorithms can also help you to solve your problems faster and in a more efficient way. That's why testing algorithmic thinking is a part of the majority of job interviews.

Learning about algorithms will help prepare you for projects that you will build during the Microverse program, for future job interviews, and for coding challenges you will encounter at your future job.

### Learn about algorithms

To make sure that you understand the concept of algorithms very well:

- Watch the [GCFLearnFree.org video explaining algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9ASKAni_s).
- Watch the [What is an algorithm and why should you care?](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/v/what-are-algorithms) video from Khan Academy.
- Play [A guessing game](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/a/a-guessing-game) from Khan Academy.

### Pseudocode

Pseudocode is an informal way of programming descriptions. It is a term that means writing programming instructions but without using any specific programming language syntax. It may vaguely resemble one or more programming languages, but is not meant to be read as runnable code.

You can use it to create an outline or a rough draft of the algorithm for the problem that you need to solve.
Pseudocode is useful for creating a plan before you start coding and also to communicate your ideas with other people in a shorthand.

- Watch this [TED Ed video that uses pseudocode to explain simple algorithm example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfOvs8pY1k).
- Check [this list of pseudocode examples](https://www.unf.edu/~broggio/cop2221/2221pseu.htm).

## Coding challenges

During almost every week at Microverse, you will be challenged with a small problem that will require algorithmic thinking. Throughout the Microverse curriculum you will learn about some widely known algorithms and use them to solve assignments.

### Why is it important?

Solving small, self-contained challenges will give you training in algorithmic thinking that will be useful for bigger projects that you build in the future. Also such challenges will likely will be part of your future job interviews, so it is essential to become skilled at solving a wide variety of them.

**Solving all coding challenges is a requirement to pass a block.** As in the case of projects, you will request a review and we will approve or reject your submission. In this case, you will have ten review attempts, and you can NOT use extra code reviews for coding challenges.

### Trivial interview questions

The first 5 coding challenges that you will need to solve will be fairly trivial but are very common job interview questions:

- Read the article [How to beat 5 common JavaScript interview challenges](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-common-coding-interview-challenges).
- In the next steps, you will need to solve the same or similar challenges on your own.

### How to use GitHub Classroom?

For the majority of Microverse coding challenges you will be using GitHub Classroom assignments:

- Read [How to use GitHub Classroom?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-computer-science-fundamentals/blob/main/trivial-interview-questions/articles/how_to_use_github_classroom.md) to familiarize yourself with this tool (no worries, since you already know Git and GitHub it will be easy for you).

### How to request a review and submit your coding challenges?

Last but not least, your coding challenge solution will go through an automated review process. The system will check that you have submitted a valid repo that exists on GitHub, that it’s a repo of your own, and that it solves the coding challenge (thus, it has passed all checks and is green). 

First, you will request a review of your repo by pasting the link in the submission form that appears in your Dashboard. NOTE: Make sure that you have pushed your solution to the main branch. When the system has checked your submission, the activity status will change to:

- Changes requested (if it’s not approved),
- Invalid submission (if the solution could not be processed by the system), or
- Incomplete (if you have used your ten reviews and your submission has not been approved still).
- Submit (if it is approved). Now, you should submit your solution to complete the activity.

You will have a maximum of 10 reviews to get your coding challenge approved.

Refer to the article [How to request a coding challenge review at Microverse](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/how-to-request-a-coding-challenge-review-at-MV.md) to familiarize yourself with this process.
